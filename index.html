   <h3>Biography</h3>
     <p> Marcelo Alvarez was born in Chile in 1989. When he was a child, he was part of a soccer team, and was really good at it. When Marcelo was around 15 years old, he injured his knee which made it difficult for him to play. With time he decided to leave the team and only play for fun.</p>
     <p> He met his wife a few weeks before his 18th birthday, had a child by the time he was 19 years old, and got married at 21. At 23 years old, Marcelo moved to the US to be with his wife and child. He came to the US knowing very basic English and started out by working at a donut shop and is now completing his Bachelors in Business while working at the hospital, having a self-employment job, and a family of 6.</p>
     <p> Marcelo has achieved more than what he'll ever tell you. But, if you ask him to name one thing of what he's really proud of, he'll say without a doubt, his family. It was very hard for him, and a lot it needed to be done before he could travel to the US to be with his wife and first child, but today, he has a beutiful family with four amazing children.</p>

   <h3>Family</h3>
     <p>Marcelo met his wife, Karina, while in his senior year of High School. He would often tease her for being moved down to junior year halfway through the school year. Karina had recently returned from the US and attempted to continue her senior year but was required to take an exam for each subject. She failed the biology test and the principal decided to move her down to the junior year instead (although she had already completed half her senior year with no problem at all).</p> 
<p>She moved back to the US after a year and discovered she was pregnant. By that time, Marcelo was going to start college. Instead, he decided to find a job to send money to her and his new baby while saving enough money to request a visa. Everything got harder, and he was denied multiple times.</p> 
<p>By the end of 2008, his firstborn was born, and he was unable to make it. Years passed, where he kept trying to get a visa. By 2011 his still girlfriend was able to travel to Chile, and they were able to get married. He was also able to meet his daughter, who was turning 3yrs in 2 months. After they were married, his wife and daughter had to move back to the US. They were able to visit again during Christmas time. 2 years passed, and by 2013 he was finally able to move to the US as a resident. Now, almost 7 years later, he’s still happily married and has four beautiful children.</p>

    <h3>Inspirations and Goals</h3>
      <p>Marcelo loves bettering himself every day. At first, one of his biggest inspirations and goals was to fight to be with his family in the US. It took him six very long years to accomplish it, but he persevered to the end. Since then, he has treasured every moment he spends with family and has focused on bettering himself as a person by reading books and putting his faith in God.</p>
      <p>One of his goals is to have a family business. He currently has a self-employment job where he resells books through Amazon. But his dream is to one day have a software development business.</p>

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>Marcelo has developed an interest in reading for the past two years. He started out by reading a personal development book around 2018. Today, Marcelo has read over 15 books, most of these in personal development. He has a goal this year to read a book every month. A few of his favorite books are The Compound Effect, A Whole New Mind, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, and Siddhartha.</p>
      <p>Another of his hobbies is playing the guitar. He used to play a lot while living in Chile, but since he came to the US and had her second child, he hasn’t been able to play as much. For this year, he set the goal to learn how to play a new song on the guitar every month. He loves to play the guitar, and his children enjoy singing with him.</p>
      <p>Marcelo also loves soccer. Being from Chile means one of your passions is soccer. Either playing it, watching it or both. Every four years, there’s a world cup, where teams from many countries around the world must earn their spot in the game and play to win the cup. He also watches Chilean soccer players who play in big teams such as Arturo Vidal, who plays in Barcelona.</p>
